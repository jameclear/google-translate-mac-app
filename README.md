# Google Translate Mac App

![Hero](/images/hero.jpeg)

The main idea of this app is to quickly switch to the translator. I used to have pinned tab in chrome:

But still, you can't use a simple keyboard shortcut to go there. Moreover you loose sense of where its frame is open.
As a result, I've created the pure wrapper for Google Translator website:

In addition to that, you receive beautiful icon:

Since it's just a browser window you still can navigate anywhere clicking on the links but I think it's a bad idea to intercept anything like this. You can always reopen the window getting back to the translator. In addition to that, you have persistent authentication out of the box.
